# geocoding
Python code to geocode lists of addresses in Python. 
With this code you will be available to only geocode a maximum of 2500 registers since it is the free limit that Google Maps API permits. 

With the simple code below you will be able to geocode a list of addresses from a dataset with two special characteristics:
1. It will be automatic
2. You will know where you have an error because of typing mistakes or because of the Google API does not have that address registered.
