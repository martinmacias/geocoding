# geocoding
Python code to geocode lists of addresses in Python. 
With this version it is possible to only geocode a maximum of 2500 registers since it is the free limit that Google Maps API permits. 

The code has two special characteristics:
1. It will make the geocoding automatically.
2. It will let you know where you have an error because of typing mistakes or because of the Google API does not have that address registered.

If you want to goecode a larger list of addresses check the following link: https://gist.github.com/shanealynn/033c8a3cacdba8ce03cbe116225ced31
